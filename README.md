# Snippets & Templates

This repository is a collection of snippets, templates, and resources for working across various programming languages and frameworks.

## Description

This project offers a set of reusable resources for developers working in multiple languages and frameworks, including JavaScript, Python, and Vue.js. These resources are designed to speed up project development and improve code consistency through the reuse of common snippets and templates.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into subdirectories corresponding to the different languages and frameworks.

Within each of these directories, you may find a variety of files organized by function or purpose. For instance, the `Js` folder might have subdirectories for testing, frontend development, and backend scripts, while `Python` might contain subdirectories for data analysis, machine learning, and web development.
